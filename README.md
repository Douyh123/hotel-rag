# This is a hotel review sentiment analysis project!

## Project Introduction
This project is written in Python and uses the "Qwen/Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct" model.

Multiple suggestion templates were designed (zero-sample, few-sample, CoT), and the optimal strategy was selected through comparative experiments.

Based on the local "Qwen/Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct" model, it automatically processes 1000+ real reviews, generating sentiment tags and keywords.

Finally, the generated results are saved as a CSV file.
